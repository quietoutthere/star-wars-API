# Star Wars Database

Interested in your favorite Star Wars character's homeworld, or weight? Simply type in their name (i.e., "Darth Maul"), run the search, and the information will be displayed on a nicely organized table! If you would like to just simply scroll through a list of characters, use the pagination below the table!

## Description
This is my second project using React.js framework and my first project using a RESTful API. Holy, moly did it feel good to get this one out of the way. I really had to dig down deep into the nitty gritty of programming to totally understand how to manipulate the data. The first area I had to research was properly understanding JSON, considering all the API data was returned as such. Secondly, I had to research and watch tutorials on asynchronous programming. I had initially begun my project using .then / .catch to make the information malleable, however, once I discovered async / await, my code was cleaned up to a more readable display. Cycling through the data and displaying it on a Bootstrap table was a relatively easy task, however, the next brick wall I ran into head first was activating and disabling my Bootstrap pagination buttons. I turned to Edabit and continually drilled loops to figure out the logic behind each ‘numbered button’. I also really had to understand props in order to get the information I needed all the way from my parent component ‘Header.js’, down to the lowest child component: the pagination.

All in all I am very happy with how it works, as well as how it looks.
