## Description
This is my second project using React.js framework and my first project using a RESTful API. Holy, moly did it feel good to get this one out of the way. I really had to dig down deep into the nitty gritty of programming to totally understand how to manipulate the data. The first area I had to research was properly understanding JSON, considering all the API data was returned as such. Secondly, I had to research and watch tutorials on asynchronous programming. I had initially begun my project using .then / .catch to make the information malleable, however, once I discovered async / await, my code was cleaned up to a more readable display. Cycling through the data and displaying it on a Bootstrap table was a relatively easy task, however, the next brick wall I ran into head first was activating and disabling my Bootstrap pagination buttons. I turned to Edabit and continually drilled loops to figure out the logic behind each ‘numbered button’. I also really had to understand props in order to get the information I needed all the way from my parent component ‘Header.js’, down to the lowest child component: the pagination.

All in all I am very happy with how it works, as well as how it looks.
